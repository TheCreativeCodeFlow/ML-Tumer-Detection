## 🎯 Model Selection Guidelines

### For X-ray Images:
- **Bone/Skeletal**: Use Bone Fracture Detection Model
- **Other structures**: Consider general abnormality classification

### For Head CT Scans:
- **Suspected bleeding**: Use Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Model
- **General assessment**: May use brain tumor model as secondary

### For Brain MRI:
- **Tumor screening**: Use Brain Tumor Detection Model (primary)
- **General abnormalities**: Use MRI Brain Abnormality Classification Model
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Consider running both models

## 🏥 Clinical Workflow Integration

### Emergency Department:
1. **Injury Cases**: Start with Bone Fracture Detection for skeletal injuries
2. **Head Injuries**: Use Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection for rapid assessment
3. **Neurological Symptoms**: Brain Tumor Detection for mass lesion screening

### Radiology Department:
1. **Second Opinion**: Use appropriate model based on imaging modality
2. **Screening**: Run relevant model for population screening programs
3. **Quality Assurance**: Cross-reference AI findings with radiologist interpretation

### Research Applications:
1. **Algorithm Development**: Use all models for comprehensive analysis
2. **Dataset Validation**: Compare model performance across different conditions
3. **Clinical Studies**: Integrate AI findings with clinical outcomes

## ⚠️ Important Clinical Considerations

### Model Limitations:
- Models require clinical validation
- False positives/negatives possible
- Image quality affects performance
- Population bias may exist

### Clinical Integration:
- Always correlate with clinical symptoms
- Use as decision support, not replacement
- Document AI assistance in clinical notes
- Follow institutional AI use policies

### Quality Assurance:
- Verify image quality before analysis
- Review AI confidence levels
- Correlate with clinical presentation
- Consider additional imaging if uncertain

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### High Confidence Results (>80%):
- Strong AI evidence
- Recommend clinical correlation
- Consider as supportive evidence

### Moderate Confidence (60-80%):
- Suggestive findings
- Additional imaging may be warranted
- Clinical correlation essential

### Low Confidence (<60%):
- Uncertain findings
- Clinical evaluation recommended
- Consider alternative imaging modalities

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Select Appropriate Model**: Based on image type and clinical question
2. **Upload Medical Image**: JPEG, PNG, or DICOM format
3. **Review AI Analysis**: Check confidence levels and attention maps
4. **Clinical Correlation**: Integrate findings with patient presentation
5. **Documentation**: Save results and clinical notes
6. **Follow-up**: Plan additional imaging or referrals as needed
