    self.model_name,
    trust_remote_code=True
)

# Improved error handling
try:
    # prediction logic
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Prediction error: {e}")
    return "Error in prediction", 0.0, np.array([0.0])
```

**Key Features:**
```python
def load_image(file_buffer: io.BytesIO, filename: str):
    """Load image from bytes with enhanced error handling.
    
    Args:
        file_buffer: Binary file buffer
        filename: Name of the file to determine type
        
    Returns:
        PIL Image in RGB format
        
    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If DICOM file is provided but pydicom not installed
        Exception: For other file loading errors
    """
```

- ✅ More descriptive validation results
- ✅ Better separator formatting for readability

**Key Features:**
```python
# Enhanced error messages
print(f"  💡 This may indicate the model needs special configuration")
print(f"  💡 Model may require specific dependencies or authentication")
```
